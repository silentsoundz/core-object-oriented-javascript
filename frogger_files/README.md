Welcome to my frogger game... it is a simple version with no bells or whistles.

You will start the game with a character in the grass... that is you. Your goal is to make it to the water as many times as you can without colliding into the enemy. Your enemy in this game looks like a bug. They are always on the move so keep an eye out for them. You have the options to move in all 4 directions by using the arrows they are direction sensitive. If you have a ruin with a bug you will be sent back to start/ if you reach the water you will also be sent back to start. If I had more time and code experience there would be something special for you if you made it to the water. My apologies.... Have fun and good luck.
